# JPEGimage_metadata_extraction
Basic digital forensic script to extract EXIF data from a JPEG image

This simple Python script can extract metadata from a JPEG image using the Pillow library in Python. Pillow is a library that
provides numerous functions to alter, manipulate or otherwise interact with images in Python. The data extracted is called EXIF
(Exchangeable Image File Format), which gives information about when and how an image was created.

At some point I'll upload a script to allow metadata extraction from other types of images such as TIFF or PNG.
